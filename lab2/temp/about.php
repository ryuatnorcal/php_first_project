		<p> Hi!! Owner of this site is Ryu whoes major is Computer Science. 
		    I am still in process to finish up my CS degree at college though. 
		    The orign of begining CS was that I watched degimon anime when I 
		    was kid and then I thought I would be programmer because that's 
		    super cool!! That type of stuff makes me  be involved into CS major. 
		    I have been studying CS for 3 semesters so far. Therefore, I am still 
		    beginer, I guess.
 			I would like to practice a lot and share what I've done that's why 
 			I created this site. I have done so far....</p>

		<p>I am try to use arch linux right now. Arch linux is pretty awesome 
		   coz you can customise everything even though desktop emviroment. 
		   So If you use an Arch linux, you can get the linux machine which is 
		   costumised for only you. and you can study how OS works.</p> 
        <p>I also post some kind of my hobby videos and pictures such as 
           skateboarding, snowboarding, surfing and trans/techno music. 
           Those links are kind of memo of my favorite youtube videos, 
           potscasts and so on. So feel free to see that and have a fun!!</p>
